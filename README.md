RPi-SenseStation
================
[üá∞üá∑ ÌïúÍµ≠Ïñ¥](README.ko.md)

Some dumb DIY work with my [Raspberry Pi 3](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/) + [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/), making RPi a **total control and monitor tower** of my IoT devices and attached sensors.

<s>YAY such a money-wasting DIY project! but at least I gave my rolling-on-the-floor Raspberry Pi 3 a usage ;)</s>

Why are you doing this? Aren't you reinventing the wheels?
==========================================================
 - Just for fun!
 - Buying a finished product is very costly!
 - Building my own useful device is very accomplishing! isn't it?
 - Make a good experience and keep my *smol* hardware/electrician skill!
 - <s>Hey, what's the problem? I **just** wanted to build this from scratch, so don't bother me</s>
